# DragAndDrop
## Purpose of this app
This app is meant to use the drag and drop mechanics where users can add their projects to the library. The whole projects is done in TS to make the inputs very strict.

## Structure of this project
At first whole code was written in one file. The next step was to distibute the code to multiple files so that is more readable. For this we have three options:

- 1st we could distribute the code to multiple files and use the export and import system. This also includes bundling via third-party packs, such as Webpack.
- 2nd using Namespaces to group the code
- 3rd File bundling, where per file or bundled compilation is possible and there are less imports to manage

## Technologies used
- TypeScript 
- HTML 
- CSS

## Future development
- added local storage 
- adding other functionalities to the app
- make the app mobile and used crossplatform
